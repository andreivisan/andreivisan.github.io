title: Android HTTP server with AndroidAsync
published: true
---

Yesterday, in a previous post, I wrote about how to write an HTTP server inside your Android application using <a href="https://github.com/NanoHttpd/nanohttpd" target="_blank"> NanoHTTPD </a>. After a bit more research I found that <a href="https://popcorntime.io/" target="_blank"> Popcorntime </a> for Android were using NanoHTTPD as well and that they have replace it with another library called <a href="https://github.com/koush/AndroidAsync" target="_blank">AndroidAsync</a>.

After reading a bit about <a href="https://github.com/koush/AndroidAsync" target="_blank">AndroidAsync</a> I found out that the code is much better than the one for <a href="https://github.com/NanoHttpd/nanohttpd" target="_blank"> NanoHTTPD </a> as well as the way of handling requests is more clear from the code reading perspective.

One of the main difference between the two is that NanoHTTPD is using threads while AndroidAsync is based on NIO. I can't tell you which one is better in terms of speed as I didn't test this yet, but I will let you know as soon as I have more data on both.

###Let’s start coding
Before starting the exciting coding make sure you add the following code to your AndroidManifest.xml file:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_WIFI_STATE"></uses-permission>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"></uses-permission>
```

For this project I also used Gradle. So in order to add <a href="https://github.com/koush/AndroidAsync" target="_blank">AndroidAsync</a> to your project add the following line to your build.gradle file:

```java
compile 'com.koushikdutta.async:androidasync:2.+'
```

Now let’s modify MainActivity.java accordingly:

```java
import android.os.Bundle;
import android.support.v7.app.AppCompatActivity;
import android.view.Menu;
import android.view.MenuItem;

import com.koushikdutta.async.AsyncServer;
import com.koushikdutta.async.http.server.AsyncHttpServer;
import com.koushikdutta.async.http.server.AsyncHttpServerRequest;
import com.koushikdutta.async.http.server.AsyncHttpServerResponse;
import com.koushikdutta.async.http.server.HttpServerRequestCallback;


public class MainActivity extends AppCompatActivity {

    private AsyncHttpServer server = new AsyncHttpServer();
    private AsyncServer mAsyncServer = new AsyncServer();

    @Override
    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);
    }

    @Override
    public boolean onCreateOptionsMenu(Menu menu) {
        getMenuInflater().inflate(R.menu.menu_main, menu);
        return true;
    }

    @Override
    public boolean onOptionsItemSelected(MenuItem item) {
        int id = item.getItemId();
        if(id == R.id.action_settings) {
            return true;
        }
        return super.onOptionsItemSelected(item);
    }

    @Override
    public void onResume() {
        super.onResume();
        startServer();
    }

    private void startServer() {
        server.get("/", new HttpServerRequestCallback() {
            @Override
            public void onRequest(AsyncHttpServerRequest request, AsyncHttpServerResponse response) {
                response.send("Hello!!!");
            }
        });
        server.listen(mAsyncServer, 8080);
    }
}
```

Now start the application and after go to your device’s browser or to your emulator’s browser and type http://localhost:8080/ and you should see:
<b>
Hello!!!
</b>

I assume the code above is pretty self explanatory and it doesn't need too much description. But what I did was to add a new AsyncHttpServer and handled a GET request to which we respond with the String "Hello!!!". Also we made our server to listen on port 8080. You can choose any port you want.

I suggest you create a separate class that handles all the server methods. In this case I have added it in the MainActivity.java for convenience purposes.
In order to stop the server you have to call the following methods:

```java
server.stop();
mAsyncServer.stop();
```

That’s about it.
